	doi = {10.1002/sim.1815},
	abstract = {We consider modelling interaction between a categoric covariate T and a continuous covariate Z in a regression model. Here T represents the two treatment arms in a parallel-group clinical trial and Z is a prognostic factor which may influence response to treatment (known as a predictive factor). Generalization to more than two treatments is straightforward. The usual approach to analysis is to categorize Z into groups according to cutpoint(s) and to analyse the interaction in a model with main effects and multiplicative terms. The cutpoint approach raises several well-known and difficult issues for the analyst. We propose an alternative approach based on fractional polynomial (FP) modelling of Z in all patients and at each level of T. Other prognostic variables can also be incorporated by first constructing a multivariable adjustment model which may contain binary covariates and FP transformations of continuous covariates other than Z. The main step involves FP modelling of Z and testing equality of regression coefficients between treatment groups in an interaction model adjusted for other covariates. Extensive experience suggests that a two-term fractional polynomial (FP2) function may describe the effect of a prognostic factor on a survival outcome quite well. In a controlled trial, this FP2 function describes the prognostic effect averaged over the treatment groups. We refit this function in each treatment group to see if there are substantial differences between groups. Allowing different parameter values for the chosen FP2 function is flexible enough to detect such differences. Within the same algorithm we can also deal with the conceptually different cases of a predefined hypothesis of interaction or searching for interactions. We demonstrate the ability of the approach to detect and display treatment/covariate interactions in two examples from controlled trials in cancer.},

	abstract = {In a large simulation study reported in a companion paper, we investigated the significance levels of 21 methods for investigating interactions between binary treatment and a continuous covariate in a randomised controlled trial. Several of the methods were shown to have inflated type 1 errors. In the present paper, we report the second part of the simulation study in which we investigated the power of the interaction procedures for two sample sizes and with two distributions of the covariate (well and badly behaved). We studied several methods involving categorisation and others in which the covariate was kept continuous, including fractional polynomials and splines. We believe that the results provide sufficient evidence to recommend the multivariable fractional polynomial interaction procedure as a suitable approach to investigate interactions of treatment with a continuous variable. If subject-matter knowledge gives good arguments for a non-monotone treatment effect function, we propose to use a second-degree fractional polynomial approach, but otherwise a first-degree fractional polynomial (FP1) function with added flexibility (FLEX3) is the method of choice. The FP1 class includes the linear function, and the selected functions are simple, understandable, and transferable. Furthermore, software is available. We caution that investigation of interactions in one dataset can only be interpreted in a hypothesis-generating sense and needs validation in new data. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
